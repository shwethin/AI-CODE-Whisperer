### 2️⃣ One Object 3D Scene
🔗 Live Demo: (https://interactive3dshapes.lovable.app/)

-Interactive 3D Shapes is a visually engaging app that helps you understand 3D geometry through real-time interaction. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore different shapes to clearly see their structure, faces, edges, and dimensions. Designed for easy learning and quick understanding, the app makes complex 3D concepts simple, intuitive, and fun

### 3️⃣ AI Travel Agent
🔗 Live Demo: (https://ai-travel-agent-tier-gs7v.bolt.host/)   

AI Travel Agent is a multi-agent AI system designed to create realistic, cost-controlled travel itineraries. A dedicated Researcher Agent gathers factual travel data such as transport, accommodation, activities, and food costs, while a Planner Agent organizes this information into a day-wise itinerary with enforced budget and time constraints. The platform provides live cost breakdowns tailored to user-selected travel tiers—budget, mid-range, or luxury—and automatically replans trips if costs exceed tier limits, ensuring financial feasibility and logical trip structure.

# ⚙️ Technical Details

The application was built as a web-based system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and modular user interface. The core problem-solving logic was developed with AI assistance from Lovable, which helped in generating, refining, and debugging code efficiently.
The architecture follows a lightweight client-side execution model, enabling fast response times with minimal network overhead. Throughout development, AI tools were used to optimize control flow, handle edge cases, and improve code readability, while final logic and outputs were validated manually.

# 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

We began by splitting the three problem statements among the three team members, enabling parallel development and faster iteration. Each member explored AI-assisted development using VSCode copilot and Lovable to generate solutions, debug errors, and refine logic.

In the initial phase, we evaluated both tools based on prompt effectiveness, code structure, debugging quality, and reasoning clarity, while manually validating logic and edge cases to ensure correctness.

As the project progressed, Lovable proved more reliable in terms of contextual understanding, cleaner code generation, and iterative refinement. We standardized our workflow around Lovable and used it extensively for algorithm refinement, debugging, optimization, and code cleanup.
AI was used strictly as a development aid, with final solutions achieved through continuous testing, prompt iteration, and manual verification—maintaining a strong focus on core problem-solving skills.
